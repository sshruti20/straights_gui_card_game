Bonus Features

1.) Textual record of player's plays
• For each player, there is a textual record of the plays they have
made located just below the number of discards. It gets updated after
every turn.

2.) Visual cues to legal card
• The legal cards in a player's hand are highlighted with a green background color.

3.) Smarter AI
• The computer's AI has been optimized to increase the likelihood of the AI winning.
The computer will always discard the card with the lowest value in order to minimize its score.
Also, the computer will always play the highest ranked legal card in order to reduce the likelihood
of a higher ranking card being discarded in the future.
• To test the feature, choose at least one computer player after hitting 'start' button , and observe the
moves of the computer player. One can see the moves optimized for winning ,instead of the default part 1
implementation of project where the computer plays/discards the first card in order.

4.) Improved UX and UI
• A notification alerting the player when they try to make an illegal move.
• To test the feature, when there are green highlighted cards in the player's hand, click a
non highlighted card (which would be an illegal move) and that would case the notification
to appear.
